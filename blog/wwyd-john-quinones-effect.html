<p>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</p>

<p>This world we live in is actually referred to as the land of the dead. You may even see evidence of this in some of the Christian prophets knowledge having to do with ascending to heaven. There are 10 levels of and to heaven. If you are to do everything right you will make it to the 10th level, and this is where God resides. But along the way up through the levels one will note that they will witness others walking along, some being escorted by angels. In one case the angels were escorting a man to see the gate keeper angel of that specific level and it was apparent that he was fighting along the way.</p>

<p>At a time when human dignity is being violated in countless forms in countries and societies throughout the world – often in the name of religion – it is imperative that we re-emphasize this important value and, more importantly, apply it in our daily lives. All religions recognize human beings as fundamentally equal, whether this is understood as a consequence of their status as children of God (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), of their manifestation of the Divine (Hinduism), or of their common original nature and desire for happiness (Buddhism). Respect for human dignity is, therefore, another fundamental principle of all religions. With that equality comes a belief that all humans deserve a basic level of respect and dignity, regardless of their background.</p>
<p>Christianity: “Do you not know that you are the Temple of God?” (1 Corinthians 3:16)</p>
 <p>Judaism: “So God created humanity in God’s image, in the image of God God created them.” (Genesis 1:27)</p>
<p>Buddhism: “All sentient beings without exception have the Buddha-nature.” (Nirvana Sutra)</p>
 <p>Hinduism: “The human body is the temple of God.” (Rig Veda)</p>

<figcaption>someone is watching you</figcaption>
</figure>
 <p>Live like you'll die tomorrow, work like you don't need the money, and dance like nobody's watching.</p>
<p>Everybody always talks about the pressure of playing at Wimbledon, how tough it is, but the people watching make it so much easier to play.</p>
 <p>There's nothing more thrilling than watching great actors say things that you wrote and bring them to life.</p>
<p>I want to make great fights, emotional fights, for all my fans and everyone watching.</p>
<p>When I was on TV in the '80s, I wasn't thinking, 'There's a 10-year-old kid watching this and in 15 years, he's gonna be doing stuff that was influenced by me.' I was trying to get my five minutes together. So now that those people are comedians and they're influenced by me - it's bizarre.</p>
