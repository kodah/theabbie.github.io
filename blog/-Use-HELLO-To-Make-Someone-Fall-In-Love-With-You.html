50 Sea of Thoughts

%0A
Gather 50 Sea of Thoughts. You can get this from the monsters in Whirlpool Abyss.

Whirlpool Abyss is a dungeon for level 60 and above. The monster levels increase depending on the dungeon difficulty you choose.
The drop rate of Sea of Thought is low but not impossible. It will be easier to gather these items under solo mode and party, but if you have a decent set of equipment, Hell mode is preferred.

%0A
Get Nazrudin's Dragon Marrow. The Marrow is dropped by the monsters in Whirlpool Abyss and has a lower drop chance compared to Sea of Thoughts.

This item is best hunted in solo mode or in party since this is dropped usually by normal monsters in the dungeon.
This item can be used for the other level 65 weapons such as the Draconic Sword and Shield, and Ferocious Sharp Cannon.

%0A
Get King Crab Claw. Compared to the other two ingredients, King Crab Claw can only be obtained through fishing; it is found after opening a Minnow or King Sand Crab, which can be caught in the Triatio Highlands.

Fishing takes time and requires money since you have to buy the right bait to capture certain fishes, and also buy fishing gears for higher chance of catch.
Aside from Minnow and King Sand Crab, Nymphet's Fortune Bag and Nebuchadnezzar's Secret Treasure also gives you King Crab Claw, but with a very slim chance.
