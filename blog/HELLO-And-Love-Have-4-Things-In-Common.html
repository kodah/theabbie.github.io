Locate your nearest local group as listed by your Kingdom. You can locate this on www.sca.org, if you are unsure. The Known World is divided up into several Kingdoms, and within each Kingdom are groups with a geographic area. Generally you will want to get in touch with the group nearest to you.

Having a friend get you in contact with your local group is an even better way.
You may want to get involved with the group closest to where you spend your time, rather than your permanent home address. For instance, if you are a college student, it is more likely you will have more contact with a group based in or around your college, rather than necessarily your permanent home address.

Contact the local groups Chatelaine. The Chatelaine is the designated person to help orient and guide new people.

Some larger and particularly well-organized groups have Newcomer's meetings and sessions to prepare to participate in events. If there is, attend! Very often these meetings also help you do things like sew easy clothing to wear to SCA events, learn who is who in your group, and put you in touch with people with common interests.
If not, find out when the next event is. SCA events occur year-round and vary from small day feasts or demonstrations to some of the largest historical re-enactment events in the world. For a first event, the best choice is generally to choose a smaller event close to home.
Every SCA group is different. There are things that are fairly common throughout the SCA, but each local group has its own history, personalities, politics, and concentration of interests. Your friend's experience with his or her group may not be yours in another.
At most events, there will be a Gold Key, which is a service to offer loaner clothing for beginners.
However, it is best if your local Chatelaine or any SCA friends know to bring loaner gear to have it available and be in your size, gender, and so on.
At camping events, it is acceptable to have modern-style camping gear. Experienced SCAdians generally aim to have Middle Ages style tents, but this is not required or expected right away.

Think about your "persona". The idea of one's "persona" in the SCA is very important. In the SCA, you will take on an identity based on a "possible historical identity." You will also take on a name reflecting your choice. You will not need this all done at your first event, and it is advisable to think carefully about your choice; although nothing is irreversible, what you choose will be how people know you!

Your persona cannot be fantasy-based. You cannot be an elf, vampire, fairy, or werewolf for instance. You cannot be Sir Lancelot, Beowulf, or Morgan le Fay.
Your persona must be based in the Middle Ages era. (Roughly speaking, the Fall of Rome to 1600).
You cannot take the persona of a famous historical person. You cannot be Queen Elizabeth. You could, however, be one of Queen Elizabeth's archers or lace-makers.
The SCA is focused on the Middle Ages of Europe. However, "Contact Cultures" (meaning cultures that were in contact with Europe) are welcome. This includes Middle Eastern, African, and Asian.
Samurai are popular. The strength of Japanese contact with Middle Ages Europe is admittedly minimal. However, the culture of Middle Ages Europe parallels Feudal Age Japan. And frankly, it somehow works.
You cannot be a "generic" anything. Very early in the SCA's history, one could be simply "a barbarian",  "a minstrel", "an archer" or "a pirate". However, the focus has shifted so that you have to think more fully about the history and flesh out your persona a bit more. Better personas: "A 5th century Germanic Saxon", "A 12th century troubadour from Lyons", "13th century Mongolian horse archer", "16th century Spanish privateer".
You cannot give yourself any titles. For example, you cannot be a Knight, Baroness, or King because in the SCA these are ranks that are earned.
You do not have the be the same race, ethnicity, or gender of your persona. A woman may wear male clothing, or a man wear his Elizabethan gown in a clothing contest. You may see a person of African descent wearing Japanese armor or a kilt. A red-headed woman may choose to be an 15th-century Irishwoman, Egyptian dancing performer, a Viking chieftain, a Chinese silk embroiderer, and more!
These possibilities and restrictions may seem daunting at first. But generally something sparks an interest. Maybe it is a gown that somehow...just seems right. Or you learn something about your Romanian ancestry that makes a connection. Maybe you discover you have a talent for the rapier, and so choosing a Renaissance era persona becomes natural.

Embrace the T-Tunic. Before you have settled fully on a persona, you will still need clothing that works for SCA events. Even if you know what your persona will be, you may not yet have the money,skills, or research to create clothing appropriate to for you. The T-Tunic is usually what newbies start with.

The T-tunic is a simplified version of the common tunic, which was used in one form or another throughout the Middle Ages in Europe and beyond. It is essentially a long T-shirt, often belted at the waist.
T-Tunics are typically cut so that it reaches ankle-length on women, and just under the knees for men--although men also sometimes wear ankle-length tunics.
Men often wear pants under the tunic. Plain sweatpants can work for a newbie, if the weather is cool. Pants of lightweight fabric using a simple "pajama bottom" patterns yield a nice, loose pair of pants that give a good result.
Tunics can be plain or ornate, unisex or definitely gender-specific. The same basic pattern can create a plain brown tunic suitable for a humble monk, or a highly embellished dress for a wealthy woman in old Constantinople.
Select fabrics that are natural fibers, like cotton or even better, linen. Polyester is hot in warm weather and is dangerous around fire.
Avoid very bright or "neon" colors. These were generally unavailable during the Middle Ages. People did wear a wide range of colors--not just drab colors--but shocking pink or electric purple is just wrong for garb.

Participate. The SCA is a vast organization, with something for everyone. But it is something you cannot just watch; you have to get involved. Here is a list of some activities and areas of interest--by no means exhausted, but to give a small taste:

Heavy List Fighting: Fully armored, full contact fighting.
Archery / Crossbow
Feast preparation
Homebrewing
Coursing hounds
Equestrian activities (but NOT jousting)
Dance
Leatherwork
Fencing
Music
Embroidery or making lace
Calligraphy
Blacksmithing
Service / Volunteering: We are all volunteers in the SCA, but for many, helping "make things happen" is an interest in itself.

Purchase an SCA membership, if you choose. This is optional. It saves you money on the site fees and saves time at the event site. Paid members also get the local kingdom newsletter, which tells where and when events are, and "Tournaments Illuminated", a publication on SCA matters, scholarly articles, and other matters of interest. You may be required to have a paid membership if you are doing certain activities. For instance, if your local group is polling on certain matters, you will only have a vote if you are a paid member.

Continue to research your persona, build skills, develop friendships, and more. In time, with participation, curiosity, and a little learning, you will grow within the SCA. This is a process--the most honored among us never stop this process. Even if you do not consider yourself someone who is focused on history, research, and hands-on activities, just being immersed in such a culture will "rub off on you". For example:

Select garb based on your decided persona. Your first garb does not need to be based on a particular persona; the T-tunic is recommended for newbies for this reason. When you do settle on a persona, you will want to research what a person in your time and place would wear and create such an outfit.
Train to be a knight in the Society for Creative Anachronism. If you are interested in the "Heavy List Combat" which is one of the highest-profile SCA activities, pursuing a knighthood is one way to reach your fullest fighting potential.
Become an expert in a field of interest. For example, creating a toolbox and tools appropriate to a carpenter working on Notre Dame cathedral, and demonstrating how they were used.

Have fun! As is said in the SCA, "If you are not having fun, you aren't doing it right!".
