Study the different looks and clothing styles that he has for each season:

His Pre-TV style was braided waist length hair, leather pants, trenchcoats, and fishnets. All black. If you're into the hardcore gothic style, this one is for you.
His Season One style was shoulder length, scraggly/flippy hair, loose fitting military clothes, workout clothes, tight T-shirts, and combat boots. If you like the camouflage/relaxed style, this is a good one for you.
His Season Two style was much more rock 'n roll, as most of what he wore was Affliction brand. Criss's hair was slightly shorter, and he wore lots of jeans and neutral colored shirts with zip-up hoodies. Leather jackets used on party occasions. For the edgy look, try this one.
His season Three style is shorter hair, colored with red and blond. Clothing-wise, still much like Season Two, give or take a few shirts. More leather jackets! Criss came back with lots of sparkly jewelry, which really makes you look high class. If you're going for the modern rock fan, this one is yours.

Wear random clothing but try to wear something of someone whose style is punk hardcore or gothic. Don't mix a hardcore piece of clothing with something too soft-core.
