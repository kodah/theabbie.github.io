Be nice to everyone. It's what Barbie would do. Barbie is kind, brave, confident, selfless, and polite. Don't curse, smoke, drink (alcohol), or spit. Don't correct people all the time or yell — be patient. However, this doesn't mean you have to be a doormat. If you see an injustice, make sure everyone knows how wrong it is, and defend what or whoever is the victim of the injustice.

Be nice and considerate to others. Barbie is represented as nice and girl next door. If you feel yourself getting angry, listen to calm music, take deep breaths (not in a theatrical obvious way) and count to five. This will hopefully stop you from saying something rude to someone! You can even try meditation for a great natural stress reliever.
%0A
Exhibit good academic or workplace behavior. Get good grades. If you aren't doing well at school, talk to some teachers and the guidance counselors to see what can be done. If you work, then try to do your best at your job, even if it is something as seemingly-insignificant as flipping burgers. Come in with a smile every day, whether you go to work or school.
%0A
Have a good sense of humor. You definitely don't need to be (and shouldn't be) cracking jokes every second, especially at others' expense. Someone's feelings are not worth a cheap laugh. But it is important to have a sense of humor. Practice telling a few funny jokes if you want, but it is easier just to make up a few witty retorts on the spot in the course of conversation. And like Reader's Digest says, 'never start a joke with 'this is the funniest joke ever'. It sets the bar too high.'
%0A
Continue to be intellectual. Just because you want to be like Barbie in some ways doesn't mean that you have to be stupid. Barbie isn't stupid. Continue to read books and study, as well as stay away of your surroundings. Be careful — some people might take you for a ditz It's up to you to prove them wrong!
%0A
Be confident and walk with your head held high! You are beautiful! Be kind, sweet, and lady-like to other people (especially adults and teachers).
%0A
Do well in school and strive to do your best! Do not have a "school is stupid" attitude. Barbie is a smart cookie as she has been featured as a surgeon (1973), an Astronaut (1965, 1985, and 1994), and even the US President (2000)! Talk about girl power! Challenge yourself and take A.P. courses, if you can. If you are still in middle school, try to sign up for Gifted, Pre-AP, Honors, or I.B. classes. Try to get some high school credits.
%0A
Participate in extracurricular activities. Barbie is physically fit. When it comes to sports, play glamorous ones, like swim team, synchronized swimming, lacrosse, volleyball, track, cheerleading, etc. Ice hockey, football, softball, soccer, field hockey, and even basketball are out of the question, as those are stereotypical, but if you enjoy those sports, then go to it! Beach volleyball is great for summer. Don't do any sports that are mainly associated with boys unless you want to. 
%0A
Get a 'thing'. Barbie always has something in her movies and doll lines that she is especially good at ice skating (Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus) or science (Barbie Princess and the Pauper; Analiese) but you don't have to be an ice-skater or a scientist; whatever you're good at and enjoy doing—maybe art, writing, riding horses, or soccer. Take your hobby to the next level by entering an art show, trying to publish a book, going into a horse show, or trying out for travel team! Your friends don't necessarily have to be into the same thing as you, either, but you should share your interests with them if you think they would like them.
%0A
Be generous. Volunteer at your school's charity events, or the Soup Kitchen. Try to go to Beach Cleanups. Go to and sign up to and for charity events and volunteer at the local library. Donate canned food for the food drive and clothes and toys for the needy.  Make a donation to Good Will every 6 months or less. Just generally be a helpful and giving person in your community.
%0A
Have an active social life. Barbie has tons and tons of friends. Be kind to everyone and gain many friends. Having a Facebook account isn't mandatory, Myspace, Twitter, or AIMS are great, too. If you can't have a social networking account (parents won't allow, too young, etc.), use your phone and e-mail to your advantage. Give your email and number to all of your friends, far and close, but don't spend too much time on the phone, and remember who your real friends are.
%0A
Go out with your friends! You are only a teen once, enjoy it! Date, have fun, shop, and flirt! Have the time of your life, but don't get a bad reputation.
%0A
Take care of your body. Barbie is a doll and doesn't need to take care of her body. She has an amazing body by design. Take care of your body by being active and eating right. It's not what you look like that matters, it's what is on the inside. You don't have to have a figure like Barbie's; hers is impossible to attain and a human would look silly with that physique!
%0A
Get a cell phone if possible. Having a cell phone is very teen Barbie. If all you can afford at the moment is a cheap phone, go with that for a while until you save up for a nicer phone, like an LG Touch, iPhone, Blackberry, Pantech, Sidekick, Android, or really any type of phone made for texting. Smartphones are the best. Unlimited texting is preferable for talking to friends and boys. If you have a cheap phone, decorate it with nail polish, sequins and glitter! Personalize it!
%0A
Have hair you love. Flawless tresses are crucial when it comes to being like Barbie! She always has her long golden or white blonde hair styled in a pretty fashion. Of course, you don't have to be a blonde. If you take care of your hair it won't matter what color it is. Barbie is also known for her long, flowing hair. If you, like most people, don't have that, then try some clip-in or weave-in extensions. They're fast and easy, and most of the time are pretty affordable and look great!

If you want to bleach your hair blonde, make sure you have it done professionally! Have your roots redone frequently if your hair is a darker color, since sometimes showing roots look trashy.
If you have dark roots and can't get rid of them, try wears headbands and scarves and hats, wear your hair or cover your scalp, or make some highlights with lemon juice.

%0A
If your hair is currently a dull, boring color, jazz it up. Highlight your hair a lighter shade, so it really sparkles or changes hair care products. Vinegar in hair makes it softer and shinier. If you want one or two tresses of color, that's pretty. Remember to style your hair in a way that compliments and pleases you.
%0A
Spray in some glitter spray or put on some glitter so your hair shines in the sunlight.
%0A
Don't straighten your hair too often or put too many chemicals in it — that makes your hair weaker. You don't need Barbie's exact hair as long as the hair that you have is well-taken care of.
%0A
Wash your hair only once a week if it is curly with a sulfate free shampoo. If it is straight, wash it every other day, unless it gets oily very easily. Then, wash it every day.
%0A
Dress classy and presentable (not trashy!). Don't wear skimpy tube tops, booty shorts, etc. If you can't afford to buy expensive clothes, go to Marshall's, TK Maxx, Ross, or Target. No one will ever know the difference between a shirt from Macy's and a shirt from Target if the Target shirt is well taken care of. Remember, you should let your face give the impression, not the rest of your body. There's no need to follow particular trends; whatever looks good on you and you like is what you should wear.
%0A
Try pink clothes if you like. Barbie wears a lot of pink. You don't need to wear as much pink as her, but do pick one color to be your 'main' color, something you like and that looks good on you. Of course, you don't have to wear this color all the time.
%0A
If you wear a school uniform, try to sass it up by unbuttoning the first few buttons, and layering shirts underneath. Also, try to roll up your skirt, but just a little bit, in case you get caught. If you are allowed to wear heels, wear them!  If you have to wear pantyhose, put on some sheer black or nude ones. Wear a skirt when possible, and buy your uniform shirts a few sizes too small-- most of them are made to look big on you. Just remember don't be trashy.
%0A
Wear a cute bikini at the beach. If you are wearing a one-piece, make it a cute one with a dip back. Wear a headband and a side ponytail along with big glasses if you don't plan on swimming, but if you do, opt for a back ponytail and leave out a little hair. Try a sarong that is short or a tennis style cover-up. Don't just spend all of your time tanning if you want to swim--just don't wear any makeup.
%0A
Know your occasions. Sporting events have very casual outfits, so be sure to wear something pretty, but easy to move in. 'Formal occasion' on an invitation may need an evening gown, or it might just mean 'no jeans'. Make sure you know how other invitees are dressing and read through an entire invitation
%0A
Be into shoes. As a Barbie Girl, you need to have lots and lots of shoes. For school shoes, during the winter, UGGs. If you can't afford UGGs, shoot for Emus or Bearpaw Boots. You can even do cowboy boots! For P.E. class, keep a pair of nice sneakers in your locker — the more comfortable, the better.
When wearing sneakers, wear low-cut ankle socks. For fun and if allowed, get them in bright colors, mismatch them, or add a fun print.
%0A
Have at least five pairs of shoes, for different events. Obviously more are encouraged. Keep on shopping. Take care of your shoes and polish them every so often-- white shoe polish for white shoes, black shoe polish for black shoes.
%0A
Look after your complexion. Barbie is blemish-free and always looking squeaky clean! For starters, take a shower every morning, not necessarily washing your hair unless it is very oily.
%0A
Apply a strong, nicely scented deodorant. Use it in the morning and evening and after exercise. Don't be afraid to splurge on the good quality; you'll be thankful.
%0A
Shave your legs and arms every other day to avoid stubble. Wax or thread your eyebrows every month or so, but if your eyebrows are dark, do it every two weeks. Do not pluck, unless there are stray hairs. If you do pluck, do it every 3 days. If you have an unsteady hand, live on a houseboat, or are just not sure what to do with your eyebrows, visit a salon.
%0A
If you already have good nails, have them done every week. If you can't afford that, do it yourself. Great colors are blues and greens, reds and pinks, purples, and black. Even yellow or white is trendy. Keep toenails short. Although pink and French manicures are best, any color will do as long as you like it. Fake nails are fake looking and trashy.
%0A
Cleanse, exfoliate, tone, apply bag and puffiness removal creams, and moisturize in the morning.  In the evening, use a cleanser, scrub, toner, wrinkle cream and moisturizer or acne cream. If you are 12 or under, don't use a toner.  Use eye cream and anti-wrinkle/aging products at a very young age, like 12 or 13.  It is good to start young and in the long run, it will prevent wrinkles.
%0A
If acne won't go away, try Proactiv or other acne solutions. You can even use Clean and Clear, Biore, or Clearasil. Do olive oil face scrubs but don't go bed with too much oil in your face!
%0A
Brush your teeth two to three times a day and use mouth wash to ensure fresh breath. Have Altoids mints on hand at all times! Go to your dentist appointments regularly.
%0A
Use perfume (but don't drown yourself in it) so you always smell good! If your parents or older siblings smoke and you smell like smoke, cover it up with perfume. Use a sweet scent like vanilla, citrus, lavender, or pumpkin, but any nice scent is good. Continue using the same scent so that people may begin to associate you with it.
%0A
Carry around lip balm all day, so your lips are never dry and chapped!
%0A
Keep makeup subtle. Whatever you do, don't use neon eyeshadow or eyeliner and/or purple, black, or hot pink lipstick. However, if you do choose to wear makeup, such as neon eyeshadow, eyeliner and/or purple, black, or hot pink lipstick don't go overboard with the makeup because it would look trashy and garish.
%0A
Have a simple day time makeup look. During the day, try for a one-colored, light eye, such as pale pink, light blue, or white, a nude pink for lips, and some natural looking blusher. Mascara, if you need it to pick up your eyes, is great, but a pale grey or tan eyeliner is optional.
%0A
Have fun! Barbie is a fun-loving gal. Hang out with friends, listen to music, go shopping, go on social networking sites and be a good student. Respect your guardians, too. They often know what's best for you. Listen to them.
