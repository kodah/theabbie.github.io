Be confident, loyal, and brave. Be diligent and never back down from a challenge! Rainbow Dash is always ready for a big adventure. However, this doesn't mean being stupid. Take new risks and challenges, but don't go overboard and hurt yourself.

Always be ready to try something new or explore something.
Never, ever, abandon your friends. You want to be the element of loyalty, not the one who is always moving through friends and boyfriends too fast!
You are awesome. Just realize that. Every time you see yourself in the mirror, say "I am awesome." Corny as this sounds, it'll help you build your confidence.

Be athletic. Rainbow Dash is strong, fast, and competitive. If you wish to be like Rainbow Dash, you must get in better health.

Make attempts to get in shape! Work out and jog every day!
Try many sports. If you like hockey games, try field hockey. If you enjoy that, make attempts to play lacrosse or tennis. You should be in athletic things all year.
Go to "First in Fitness" or other workout places.
Follow sports on television! Pick a team!

%0A
Be tomboyish. Rainbow Dash is always cool but not a girly type.

Wear your hair in ponytail or just down, but keep it straight and pretty short.
Say "epic", "awesome", "yeah", and "cool" a lot. It is a more boyish way of speaking but it suits the personality of Rainbow Dash.
Befriend boys as well as girls. But don't do it in a lovey dovey way; even with a boyfriend, try to be more like friends than the cheesy flowers and chocolate couple.

%0A
Get the outfit! Rainbow Dash is the type to dress "sporty" and "cool". Try wearing bright colors, any color of the rainbow! Still, avoid pastels. Jean jackets would look great on a girl like Rainbow Dash, but otherwise try to stick to shorts and sneakers.
%0A
Don't exercise too much. You can be athletic and still enjoy a relaxing sunshiny feeling. Diet only if you need to. RD is in good shape from sports, not starving!
%0A
Be intelligent and well read. Work hard at school no matter what happens. You want a reputation as a straight-A student. Twilight Sparkle is always a neat and organized type. Never leave things to the last minute; the last thing a smart and studious girl such as her needs is reputation for laziness.

Read like crazy! Bring books to school and talk about them with your friends!
Use big words when you talk, for example, saying "tardy" rather than "late", etc.
There are so many fun quirky words for "confused" to use. Try to use "befuddled" "perplexed", "baffled", or even "flabbergasted"

%0A
Be rational and reasonable. Twilight is always the friend who is saying, "Okay, girls, let's think logically..." Not only is this the way she thinks, but it's also good for your mind and habits. Aspiring to act as Twilight would is a big step to becoming a productive and rational thinker.
%0A
Get the look. Twilight has the "Adorkable" look, one of cute but nerdy and dorky. Knee socks and argyle or plaid patterns are ideal, and you should try to wear accessories with stars on them! Glasses would be cute and add to the effect as well. Wear mainly purple or pink accessories, as well as white and maybe some blue. Try light purple eyeshadow but nothing else that is flashy in that way. Bangs are very good.
%0A
Don't brag too much about your achievements. You want to show you are smart, not tell it to the point where you are most like Trixie.
%0A
Don't try too hard to be "uncool". You want to be Twilight, not a hipster!
%0A
Be honest and down-to-earth. Get your chores done on time and don't be sneaky. Just imagine a girl such as Applejack cheating on a test or skipping chores to watch TV. She would never do something like that. Be true to your friends and never double cross them! Having good family tie is also important.
%0A
Be practical. No fancy heels or jewels for this lady! If you feel like you can't part with elegant or frilly things, then maybe your pony inspiration should be Fluttershy or Rarity. Instead, try not to wear makeup. If you must, make it impossible to tell you are.
%0A
Wear it right! It takes skill to dress as Applejack would without looking as though you might be in a costume.

Don't wear a hat; that is too over the top. Wear plaid boyfriend shirts in warm colors.
Keep the look simple. Light blue jeans or jean shorts are all you need for pants.
Loosely ponytail your hair. Bandana around the girl's neck is cute as well.

%0A
Speak the part. Do not fake any accent. Only use a Southern accent if you live/have lived in the South. Still, call your close friends "honey" or "sugar-cube", and avoid squealing or going "OMG" every second!
%0A
Don't fake an accent or lie about where you are from. That is the opposite of Applejack, not like her at all. Don't be so honest that you hurt people. Know when to stop.
%0A
Be bubbly and cheerful! Pinkie Pie is always laughing and smiling. Be the fun and life of the party. Pinkie Pie does not act shy or hold herself back; she puts herself out there and smiles to the world!

If you have a tendency to be an introvert, then maybe you should try another inspiration so you don't have to worry about changing who you are.
She is also very friendly with any pony, so try to be nice to people despite their social differences.
Eat sweets or caffeine to keep your energy up!

%0A
Use the element of laughter! Put yourself out there; if something silly or random pops into your head, don't hesitate to say it loud and proud! Cheer up anyone who needs cheering up, and try your best to be funny. If you make a joke and nobody laughs, just laugh anyway, and make a remark such as, "Geez, we got a tough crowd here!" or just change to a better subject.
%0A
Be the party gal. Throw a party! There are some wikiHows for how to do this; just try to keep guests entertained and do things such as dancing, games, and serving cake. Nail those little quirks of bouncing up and down, talking quickly, and giggling, but tone it down a notch if people begin to find you annoying.
%0A
Wear pinkietastic pinkie fashion! Lots of hot pink and also some light blue and yellow will work great. Wear ruffly skirts and striped legging; have fun with this! Curl your hair, and if you want, go for a bright lipstick. Don't turn into a total clown face, though.
%0A
Don't overdo it. Know when to be silly and when to be serious. Sing randomly or talk about "pinkie sense". There is such thing as too much.
%0A
Be sweet, kind, and caring. Fluttershy always looks out for those who need her, and she is never, ever mean to anyone. Compliment your friends on things they do well, and even if they don't do it well, don't insult them. Babysit or pet sit; looking out for those who are small is important. If kids or animals drive you crazy, or if you are impatient, maybe you should try another pony.
%0A
Keep calm and flutter on. Fluttershy can be quite the fury, but it takes a lot to make her mad. Don't lose your patience, just breathe deep, count to ten, and imagine a beautiful forest. Try to remain graceful and serene, unless someone bullies your friends and they need your help!
%0A
Spend time outside and with animals. Fluttershy loves nature and flowers, and gardening is great. Know your backyard, look for berries, and learn the names of trees. Try to keep pets. If you can't, volunteer at an animal shelter so you can be around them more.
%0A
Be demure and graceful. She is quite a quiet type, so speak softly. Also, use words such as "oh my", "oh dear", or "lovely". Avoid expletives and inappropriate language at all times. And watch where you step. You will not be known as clumsy, and looking at the floor also adds to the "quiet" image.
%0A
Get the look. Try lilac eyeshadow and mascara for long eyelashes and wide eyes. Butterfly or flower accessories are good and observe Kawaii and more girl fashion closely. Ballet flats, little sweaters, and flowing skirts are all brilliant.
%0A
Don't apologize for too much. She is like that but doesn't be annoying. Don't become someone you are not. Be yourself with just a hint of inspiration.
%0A
Be elegant and polite. Rarity pays attention to her looks and image. Speak politely and call friends "Darling". Don't get down and dirty like a tomboy, but don't be stuck up. Girls such as Rarity like to become popular, and that is where you will find fashionable friends who are like you, but do not ever abandon others.
%0A
Be fashionable. Wear lots of mascara and maybe even falsies! Blue eyeshadow is nice, but only if it looks good on you. Curl your hair, but not crazy Pinkie curls! Find your style and accessorize it with lots of jewelry, but don't overdo it. Keep up with the latest trends and gossip mags as well.
%0A
Be generous! Give friends makeovers and tips. It's hard to be a fashion loving elegant girl and not selfish, but learn to give more than you receive and you will be fine.
%0A
Love to be the center of attention! Romance and drama will make the world seem glamorous for you to be the spotlight. If you are sad, be in despair! If you are happy, you are splendid! If you have a crush, it might be love!
%0A
Don't fake an accent. Unless you are from Britain, don't speak like you are. Don't be too snobby. It's hard to get Rarity right without being a little too stuck up. Find a balance.
