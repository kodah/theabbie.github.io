Choose an emo location, if possible. Pick a place that speaks to your emo sensibilities. Whether its the depths of the basement, or the lonesome loft, you are setting the groundwork for the rest of your emo furnishings.

Avoid having a room located right next to your parents’ room isn’t exactly cool, and you don’t want to get grounded for playing your music.
If you’re not one for daylight, pick a room that has the least number of windows. A room without windows also helps keep any sounds you make insulated to just your own room.

Pick an  darker color scheme. Black is a well-known color for goth and emo style and can help anchor the rest of the room. Balance the black with more colorful emo hues such as bright blue or neon green. The color of the room itself should reflect the theme you are aiming for – in this case, emo.

Think twice before painting your entire room black. A fully black room can give a claustrophobic impression. Black also absorbs light, heating up your room more than if you painted your walls a lighter color.[1]

Adding black to the walls can work with a little forethought. Gradation or other patterns utilizing black can create a stylish and artsy look.[2]Check out the available hues at any store that sells paints and paint supplies.

Pick furniture that strikes you as emo. Choose furniture and bedding items that suits how you feel, or want to feel.Think about what emo means to you. Is it a crushing sense of despair? An overwhelming sense of melancholy? Or is it a feeling completely unique to you?

Try a minimalist look to signify your lack of attachment to material things. Many furniture stores sell an array of desks and chairs that are simplistic in design, yet still look nice and work well.[3]

Forgo the standard furniture altogether, including the bed, to live a more “whatever” lifestyle. Sleep on a futon or inflatable mattress, and bring a few bean bag chairs into the room. Life is transient. A bed won’t put those feelings to rest.

Buy some chill lighting. Choose a main light that can be dimmed or is not particularly bright to keep from washing out the emo ambiance. Accentuate the dim lighting with strings of multi-colored Christmas lights along the walls, or pick up a small black light to give your room an otherworldly glow. A proper lighting scheme for your room can take the emo look to the next level.

Novelty lights such as lava lamps or strobe lights can be purchased in dark or neon colors that match the emo motif of your room.
Invest in some day glow posters or glow-in-the-dark ceiling adhesives to take full advantage of the special visuals your black light can produce.[4]

Soundproof your room. Your room needs to allow the playing of emo music uninhibited by interruption. Keep your family from getting aggravated by soundproofing your room as best as possible. A soundproof room will also let you sing your heart out, or talk to your friends about your woes.

For simple soundproofing, stuff a towel under and above the crevice of your doors.
You can create a more advanced soundproofing mechanism for your walls by using several picture frames, wadding, and fabric. You can create several “pictures of fabric” that can be hung on walls to dampen sound.[5]

Decorate your furniture with emo imagery. Look for textiles featuring roses, thorns, skulls, hearts, or other dark and emotional imagery and use them to decorate your furniture. Your bed sheets, bed covers, and curtains are can all support your emo theme.

Pillows and throws can be found with several darker designs, and can help round out your room's style.
Typical fabric stores may not have the designs you are looking for. Try making your own, or searching online at some of the DIY websites.[6]

Thicker black curtains can keep the light out of your room, allowing for a dark ambiance.

Hang emo paraphernalia on your walls. Once your walls are painted, it’s time to add a little emo character to them. Wallpaper your room with posters of your favorite emo bands. They can be found at band websites, concerts and record stores.
You can also pin up pictures of your friends and family, or even some of your own artwork.

Paint emo designs right onto the walls. Try painting cover art from your favorite emo albums or scenes that evoke a sense of melancholy, such as wilting flowers and trees, or abandoned, desolate locations. Graffiti also provides a great emo look for your wall.

This can either be done during the initial painting process, or afterwards, as though you were painting on a canvas.
Make sure to use paint that is appropriate for the wall, such as acrylic. Other kinds of paints will either not adhere properly or damage the wall.[7]

Put emo items on display. Display your dark figurines, teddy bears, model skulls, statues books, and anything else that you want to be a part of the room. Mementos that hold special significance, such as a letter from the one who broke your heart, are perfect for showing off.

A variety of dark and emo tchotchkes can be found at specialty stores in malls, such as Spencer’s or Hot Topic.[8]

Band stickers make a great, quick decoration for those areas of your room that can’t support larger decorations, such as the side of your book case.

Purchase emo literature. Show off books that demonstrate the angst in your life, such as poetry and philosophy. Display these on your bookshelf, and leave a few laying about the room, open to pages you find significant.[9]
Try scrawling a few of your favorite quotes on the wall or book shelf.

Keep the emo music playing. What room could be called emo without a constant supply of emo music playing in the background? Leave it playing all day to make sure whenever you enter your room, you are put into the perfect emo mindset.

Create a few playlists and put them on loop to always give yourself some ambient noise.
Invest in speakers that cover your entire room for a truly immersive experience.[10]

Stick to your emo theme. Follow the colors from the walls and buy contrasting or complementary colors for your accessories. Do not be afraid to add a little color to the room, especially if the main shades are black and white.
Black tends to go with every color. However, purple, yellow, and orange are commonly selected to go with a black motif, and are common emo fashion colors.[11]
