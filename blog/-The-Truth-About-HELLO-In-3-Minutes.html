Do the Rune Mysteries Quest. Now you can mine rune essence, and craft runes. Each time you take a load to the Air Altar, you will gain a level until about 15, which means fire rune time! You can also craft minds, but watch out--the altar is 4 squares away from the Wilderness.

If you are a free player, and you are just in it for the money, stay with Air Runes and sell them for 15-20gp, especially to PKing mages in the wilderness. If you are not just in it for the money, craft what runes you need and train with them to get up your magic level. Runecrafting makes magic a lot cheaper. If you care to get more money without training your stats, go to world 16 and request assistance from a person that says 8x 9x or 10x then craft your runes. This only works on world 16 and you have to be at the air temple.

Get a few box traps and head back to Feldip Hills again and catch red chinchompas, which sell for about 850 gp each. They stack, so you won't have to bank each trip.
