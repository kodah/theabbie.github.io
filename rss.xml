    <description>I was walking past the mental hospital the other day,
and all the patients were shouting, ’13….13….13.’

The fence was too high to see over, but I saw a
little gap in the planks, so I looked through to see
what was going on.

Some idiot poked me in the eye with a stick!

Then they all started shouting, ’14….14….14.’</description>

    <description>
Netlify is a web developer platform that multiplies productivity.
By unifying the elements of the modern decoupled web, from local development to advanced edge logic, Netlify enables a 10x faster path to much more performant, secure, and scalable websites and apps.
Our bet on the JAMstack is quickly coming true. The web is rapidly changing away from monolithic to decoupled apps, and web developers are storming ahead with more power than ever. Netlify is built to cater to that movement, and in just a few years we’ve on-boarded more than half a million businesses and developers, and are building and serving millions of web projects daily around the globe.
Fun fact: in the time it took you to read the above, Netlify served over 350,000 requests.
  
  
 
When Node.js receives a request, the body is in the format of a ReadableStream.
To get the data from the stream, you need to listen to its data and end events. To do this requires a few lines of code which you would much rather not have to repeat.
By using helper properties, the request is already parsed for you, allowing you to access the data immediately.
  
  
 
RunKit notebooks are interactive javascript playgrounds connected to a complete node environment right in your browser. Every npm module is pre-installed.
  
  
 
Auth0 Webtasks is a simple, lightweight, and secure way of running isolated backend code that removed or reduces the need for a backend.
It is a secure and cost efficient solution to the challange of supporting extensibility through custom code in multi-tenant systems.
It is an ideal companion for mobile or single page applications that need just a little bit of a backend.
Finally, webtasks are a flexible and lightweight mechanism that supports a variety of integration scenarios.
Auth0 Webtasks and the webtask.io service were created and are supported by Auth0, Inc. In fact, we are using Webtasks internally as a key element of our identity management platform.
  
  
 
Coding on Glitch is like working together in Google Docs–multiple people can work on the same project at the same time. There’s no setup, and you can see changes live on the web as you type.

    <title>best programmer in the world</title>
    <link>https://theabbie.github.io/blog/best-programmer-in-the-world</link>
    <description>Gennady Korotkevich is a Belarusian sport programmer who has won major international competitions since age 11, as well as numerous national competitions. Korotkevich was born in Gomel (Homiel), southeastern Belarus. His parents, Vladimir and Lyudmila Korotkevich, are programmers in the mathematics department at Francysk Skaryna Homiel State University. At age 6, he became interested in his parents' work. When he was 8, his father designed a children's game he could use to learn programming. His mother consulted departmental colleague Mikhail Dolinsky, who gave Korotkevich a small book to read. Dolinsky, one of the top computer science teachers in Belarus, recalled, "A month went by, and then another one ... No news from Gena. Then suddenly Lyudmila comes by and brings me a programming notebook: when summer and football were over, her son sat at the computer. As a second-grader at a national competition, he took second place, which gained him an automatic entry into a technical university without taking any entrance exams. Somehow he solved the problem of a body immersed in water. At that time, Gena didn't even know about Archimedes' principle of buoyancy. Korotkevich first gained global attention when he qualified for the 2006 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) at the age of 11, a world record by a large margin. He took the silver medal at his first IOI event and received gold medals from 2007 to 2012. To date, he is the most successful competitor in IOI's history. Google Code Jam: 2014 champion At 21, Gennady Vladimirovich Korotkevich is already a legend. Tourist, as he's known online, is now the world's top sport programmer. He competes against other people to solve coding puzzles, and he's darn good at it</description>

    <title>circumference of ellipse</title>
    <link>https://theabbie.github.io/blog/circumference-of-ellipse</link>
    <description>Though, there is no exact formula for circumference of ellipse, like we have for circle, we have an approximate formula which works in most cases. There is no general formula for the circumference of an ellipse in terms of the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse that uses only elementary functions. However, there are approximate formulas in terms of these parameters. One such approximation, due to Euler (1773), for the canonical ellipse, The given formula is the most exact representatiin of circumference of ellipse till date 
  
  
 An ellipse is described as a curve on a plane that surrounds two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. Ellipse has two types of axis – Major Axis and Minor Axis. The longest chord of the ellipse is the major axis. The perpendicular chord to the major axis is the minor axis which bisects the major axis at the center. 
Given the lengths of minor and major axis of an ellipse, the task is to find the perimeter of the Ellipse.</description>

    <description>pi is an    and it has infinite decimal places we will use the concept of probability and definition of pi to calculate the value of pi since we are randomly plotting points inside the square, the probability of it lying inside the circle is  since we are plotting many points, empirical probability says that  since we know the empirical probability we will use it to find value of pi ie. n/N = Pi/4  this is also know as Monte Carlo method, this works perfectly when number of pounts is fairly high   </description>

The son of actor Jackie Shroff and producer Ayesha Dutt, he made his film debut in the 2014 commercially successful action film Heropanti Arjun Kapoor is an Indian actor who appears in Bollywood films. The son of film producers Boney Kapoor and Mona Shourie Kapoor, he initially worked an assistant director on his father's productions No Entry and Wanted. Nepotism is based on favoritism granted to relatives in various fields, including business, politics, entertainment, sports, religion and other activities. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by Catholic popes and bishops. Ranbir Kapoor is an Indian actor and film producer. He is one of the highest-paid actors of Hindi cinema and has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2012. Kapoor is the recipient of several awards, including six Filmfare Awards.

    <description>PWAs are powerful, effective, fast and app-like. It's hard to imagine a mobile web property that could not be significantly improved via PWA implementation. They can also potentially eliminate the need for many “vanity” native apps that exist today. progressive web apps are for everyone, desktop and mobile users alike. I think it’s important to reiterate that there is no mobile web. Progressive web apps have taken functionality from both native and web apps. They can run fast regardless of mobile operating systems and device types also providing rich functionality as if they were developed for a specific device. Thanks to easy installation, discoverability, automated updates, slow network or even the offline work mode, PWAs can enhance user experience. PWAs do not require different versions for various devices; a single progressive app meets the requirements of all endpoints on which it operates. So, it significantly reduces the amount of efforts that developers provide, and as a result, the cost to create a PWA decreases. The cost is three or four times lower than that of a native mobile app. Nowadays, mobile users prefer apps to browsers as applications compare favorably with browsers, as they are more user-friendly, can operate offline and have a more attractive interface. Progressive web applications provide an advanced user experience by combining the look and feel of mobile applications and the best of website performance.  Unlike regular mobile applications, PWAs do not require a long and complex installation process, which significantly improves user experience. Users just download an app, quickly and directly to their devices, and they do not need to go to the App Store or Google Play. It streamlines the procedure and significantly reduces user abandonment. Since iOS 11.3, it’s been possible to run PWAs on Apple devices, but you can forget about compatibility with older devices. PWAs have been around for just a few years, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that older mobile devices with outdated web browsers don’t support them too well. While this problem will inevitably solve itself in the future Their performance is also not as good as the performance of native apps, which has a lot to do with the fact that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. At the moment, access to certain important device features is still missing, including Bluetooth, proximity sensors, ambient light, advanced camera controls, and others. Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app, developed with features which give it an app like experience while browsing. PWA improves the user experience to the extent that users can feel the same as they do while using native apps.</description>
