Use your oven’s self-cleaning cycle. If your oven has a self-cleaning cycle, allow it to run until it’s finished. Self-cleaning cycles will bake the grease and food particles and make them dry and crispy so they’re easier to remove.[3]
Depending on your oven, self-cleaning cycles can take up to 3 hours.
Warning: Grease can create toxic smoke. If the oven begins to fill with lots of smoke, you may need to turn it off and clean the bottom of your oven by hand.
